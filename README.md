# Functional Programming in Scala (2nd Edition) — Scala 3

This repository contains my walkthrough of the examples and exercises from  
**_Functional Programming in Scala, Second Edition_** (aka the *Scala Red Book*),
implemented in **Scala 3**.

The goal is learning and exploration, not polished or idiomatic production code.

Expect:
- handwritten implementations
- refactors as understanding improves
- inline notes and comments
- occasional experiments that diverge from the book
